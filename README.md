# BGP-TestAutomation
This project describes how Robot Framework provides synergy in test automation, making a lot of automation processes flexible and simple for testing network protocols(in this case BGP). The test environment is implemented using virtual routers emulated using Network Emulation Tool GNS3. The emulated network details is put into JSON topology file that serves as test data to Robot Framework testsuite. All the network configurations are applied through automated scripts. These scripts not only configure the devices in the given topology but also verifies the network behavior. These testcases are written in different phases which segregate the configuration part from the actual testing and maintaining of the network. When Robot Framework is initiated, it processes the test data, executes testcases and generates logs and reports that provides comprehensive debriefing on what happened in the test execution.
